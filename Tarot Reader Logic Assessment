Bookis had had a splitting headache for days. He had tried everything he could think of to get some relief and nothing was working. He asked his mother for advice. She said, “go visit the tarot card reader on 15th and he’ll know just the cure.” Bookis was skeptical but desperate, so he decided to give it a shot. Upon entering the store, the tarot card reader said, “You’ve got a headache. I’ve got a potion to cure you, but you’ll have to guess the weights of my three prized cats (in whole kilograms).”

Bookis said he was game, but that he needed a hint. The tarot card reader said, “If you multiply the weight of each, you get 36.”

Bookis thought for a moment and said, “I need another hint.” The tarot card reader said, “If you add their weights, it's the same as the price of a tarot reading.” The tarot reader pointed at the board behind the counter with the price list.

Bookis looked up at the board and said, “Okay, I see the price, but I still don’t have enough information to answer definitively - can you give me just one more hint?” The tarot reader said, “I can’t give you a hint, but Sammy, my littlest kitty, really seems to like you!” The cat chewed on Bookis’s sleeve. At that point, Bookis exclaimed “I know the weights of your cats!”

Bookis told the tarot reader the weights, got his headache potion (which worked immediately), and pet Sammy’s head before leaving.
