##Step 5: Cave Gnome Logic Assessment
###Read the logic assessment and respond to the questions below.

<a href='#answers'>Answers</a>

A group of cave gnomes, while in a dark cave, have their foreheads painted red or blue. They cannot see the color of their own foreheads, or anything else while they are in the cave. The gnomes are asked to exit the cave one by one and automatically sort themselves by color without communicating in any way after they leave the cave (verbal or non-verbal).

####1. How did they do this? 
Gnomes are tiny, smart, and clever creatures. 
Gnome #1, a.k.a. G1, walks out of the cave, to the right (let's say, could be to the left, but he goes to the right.)
G2 walks over to G1, to the right.
G3 walks over to G1 & G2. 

At this point, G1 and G2 have seen each other, but not themselves. Neither can know what they are. 
G3 can see both G1 & G2, and see if they have the matching or differing colors. 

G4 walks out while G1, G2, and G3 are tryng to figure out what they have on their heads. 

G4 sees 2 G's of the same color and walks over to them, say she sees 2 <font color="#003399">blue</font> foreheads on <font color="#003399">G1</font> and <font color="#003399">G3</font>. 

Now G2 can see if these three are all matching or not. G2 deduces that G4 can see that she doesn't match G1 or G3, so she knows she's got Red on her forehead. 

<font color="#CC0000">G2</font> now moves over to the left of the cave while G1, G3, and G4 are to the right. 

As G5 exits the cave he walks over to the group. The group sees he's got a <font color="#CC0000">Red</font> head, so they move to the right. <font color="#CC0000">G5</font>, goes to <font color="#CC0000">G2</font> and she moves closer to him. 

And this is how it goes, no verbal communication. The Gnomes are able to move to sort them selves out, <font color="#003399">Blue</font> moves to the right, <font color="#CC0000">Red</font> moves to the left when approached by a Gnome that is not their color. 

If the Red or Blue group doesn't move away then the Gnome knows it is with it's right crew. <br>
<br>
####2. How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.

I thought about it as if I were a Gnome, as if Gnomes were people that couldn't talk, and what I and other people would be allowed to do in spite of the fact that you cannot tell in any way someone what their color is and they can't tell you what yours is. <br>
<br>
####3. What other possible answers are there?
Other possibilities that I've come up with is that they all rub their foreheads together and make <font color="#9933FF">purple</font> and then go out to drinks.
